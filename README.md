# Qwhackmolegame

# Overview

This project is an implementation of a classic arcade-style game, reimagined with a Halloween theme. I wanted to create an interactive game that combines real-time graphics, sound effects, and user input handling to create an entertaining experience as a way of exploring game development concepts.

The game is a variation of the classic whack-a-mole arcade game, where players must click on spiders(orange dots for now) as they appear in different holes across the screen. The game features:
- Score tracking system (+1 for hits, -1 for misses)
- Sound effects for hits, misses, and spider appearances
- Visual with colored graphics
- Randomized spider movement patterns

To play:
1. Run the game using Python
2. Click on the orange spiders as they appear in the white holes
3. Score points by successfully hitting spiders
4. Don't miss the spider
5. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

The purpose of developing this game was to gain hands-on experience with:
- Displaying graphics
- Sound integration in gaming applications
- Taking user input from the keyboard or mouse
- Moveable objects

# Development Environment

The game was developed using:
- Visual Studio Code as the IDE
- Python 3.13.0 as the programming language
- Git for version control

Key technologies and libraries:
- Pygame - For game development, including:
  - Graphics rendering
  - Event handling
  - Sound system
  - Display management
- Random library - For randomizing spider appearances
- OS library - For file system operations
- Sys library - For system-level operations

# Future Work

* Add difficulty levels that affect spider speed and spawn rate
* Implement a high score system with persistent storage
* Make a spider sprite instead of just an orange dot.
* Add different types of spiders with varying point values
* Add background music and more sound effects
* Implement an animation system for smoother visuals
* Add a pause menu and game over screen
